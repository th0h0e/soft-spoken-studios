For the past six years, I've been immersed in the world of brand storytelling, focusing on creating content that doesn't just look good, but genuinely connects with audiences and drives meaningful results.\n\nMy path started at **Boston University**, where I earned a degree in Film & Television. It was there I discovered my dual passion for the written word and visual storytelling. Since then, I've honed my skills in both areas, believing that the most powerful content is born from a deep understanding of both narrative craft and production technique.\n\n### Philosophy\n\nMy creative philosophy is rooted in **authenticity** and **strategic thinking**. I believe great content starts with understanding the 'why' – the audience's needs, desires, and the story that will resonate with them. I use research, scriptwriting, and iterative editing to ensure the messages I craft are truly effective.\n\nI strive to create content that feels natural and engaging, where compelling copy and striking visuals work hand-in-hand. Whether I'm writing conversion-focused web copy or directing a brand documentary, my focus is always on creating value that moves people to action.\n\n### What Drives Me\n\nWhat keeps me excited about this work is the constant evolution of storytelling and the challenge of distilling complex ideas into clear, persuasive narratives. There's nothing more rewarding than seeing a campaign launch and knowing it's helping a brand connect with their audience in a meaningful way.\n\n### Beyond the Camera\n\nWhen I'm not writing or filming, you might find me exploring Boston's independent cinema scene, capturing street photography, or experimenting with new editing techniques.\n\nThanks for stopping by. Feel free to browse my [projects](/projects) or [get in touch](/#contact) if you'd like to collaborate!\n","Learn more about my journey as a Boston-based Copywriter & Video Producer, my creative philosophy, and my passion for crafting compelling stories that connect and convert.",{"title":573,"items":574},"Projects & Experience",[575,583,591],{"position":576,"date":577,"company":578},"Lead Copywriter at","2023 -
