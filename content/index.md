  - title: Services & Process
    questions:
      - label: What services do you offer?
        content: I specialize in copywriting and video production. This includes brand messaging, website copy, email campaigns, scriptwriting, commercial production, documentary-style content, promotional videos, and social media content. My goal is to create compelling narratives that connect with audiences and drive measurable results.
      - label: What is your creative process like?
        content: My process is collaborative and strategic, typically involving stages like Discovery & Strategy, Scriptwriting & Storyboarding, Production & Filming, Editing & Revisions, and final delivery with performance tracking. I tailor the approach based on project needs, always focusing on authentic storytelling that resonates with your target audience.
      - label: Do you work with startups?
        content: Absolutely! I enjoy working with startups to help craft their brand voice and visual identity from the ground up. I can adapt my process to fit the fast-paced startup environment and create content that grows with your brand.
  - title: Pricing & Timelines
    questions:
      - label: How much does a project typically cost?
        content: Project costs vary based on scope, deliverables, production complexity, and timeline. For comprehensive brand campaigns with multiple video deliverables and copy packages, projects typically start around $6,000, with average projects ranging between $10,000 and $30,000. For consulting or single-day shoots, my day rate is $800.
      - label: What are your payment terms?
        content: I generally require a 40% deposit to schedule the project and begin pre-production, with the remaining 60% due upon successful project completion and delivery. I accept payments via bank transfer and Stripe.
      - label: How long does a typical project take?
        content: Timelines depend heavily on the project's scope and production requirements. Smaller projects like website copy or short-form video might take 2-3 weeks, while larger campaigns with multiple videos and comprehensive copy can range from 6 to 12 weeks. I always provide a detailed timeline estimate after the initial discovery phase.
      - label: Do you offer retainers or ongoing support?
        content: Yes, for clients needing ongoing content creation, monthly campaigns, or continuous social media production, I offer monthly retainer options tailored to specific needs. Let's discuss if this is something you're interested in.
  - title: About Me
    questions:
      - label: What do you enjoy most about your work?
        content: I love the challenge of distilling complex ideas into clear, persuasive narratives that move people to action. It's incredibly rewarding to see a campaign launch and watch audiences engage with the story we've crafted. Bringing together the power of words and visuals to create meaningful connections is what truly excites me.
      - label: What are your hobbies outside of work?
        content: When I'm not writing or filming, I enjoy exploring Boston's independent cinema scene, capturing street photography around the city, and experimenting with new editing techniques. I'm also passionate about documentary filmmaking and occasionally work on passion projects that tell local stories.
