  - title: Services & Process
    questions:
      - label: What services do you offer?
        content: I specialize in copywriting and video production. This includes brand
          messaging, website copy, email campaigns, scriptwriting, commercial
          production, documentary-style content, promotional videos, and social
          media content. My goal is to create compelling narratives that connect
          with audiences and drive measurable results.
      - label: What is your creative process like?
        content: My process is collaborative and strategic, typically involving stages
          like Discovery & Strategy, Scriptwriting & Storyboarding, Production &
          Filming, Editing & Revisions, and final delivery with performance
          tracking. I tailor the approach based on project needs, always
          focusing on authentic storytelling that resonates with your target
          audience.
      - label: Do you work with startups?
        content: Absolutely! I enjoy working with startups to help craft their brand
          voice and visual identity from the ground up. I can adapt my process
          to fit the fast-paced startup environment and create content that
          grows with your brand.
  - title: Pricing & Timelines
    questions:
      - label: How much does a project typically cost?
        content: Project costs vary based on scope, deliverables, production complexity,
          and timeline. For comprehensive brand campaigns with multiple video
          deliverables and copy packages, projects typically start around
          $6,000, with average projects ranging between $10,000 and $30,000. For
          consulting or single-day shoots, my day rate is $800.
      - label: What are your payment terms?
        content: I generally require a 40% deposit to schedule the project and begin
          pre-production, with the remaining 60% due upon successful project
          completion and delivery. I accept payments via bank transfer and
          Stripe.
      - label: How long does a typical project take?
        content: Timelines depend heavily on the project's scope and production
          requirements. Smaller projects like website copy or short-form video
          might take 2-3 weeks, while larger campaigns with multiple videos and
          comprehensive copy can range from 6 to 12 weeks. I always provide a
          detailed timeline estimate after the initial discovery phase.
      - label: Do you offer retainers or ongoing support?
        content: Yes, for clients needing ongoing content creation, monthly campaigns,
          or continuous social media production, I offer monthly retainer
          options tailored to specific needs. Let's discuss if this is something
          you're interested in.
  - title: About Me
    questions:
      - label: What do you enjoy most about your work?
        content: I love the challenge of distilling complex ideas into clear, persuasive
          narratives that move people to action. It's incredibly rewarding to
          see a campaign launch and watch audiences engage with the story we've
          crafted. Bringing together the power of words and visuals to create
          meaningful connections is what truly excites me.
      - label: What are your hobbies outside of work?
        content: When I'm not writing or filming, I enjoy exploring Boston's independent
          cinema scene, capturing street photography around the city, and
          experimenting with new editing techniques. I'm also passionate about
          documentary filmmaking and occasionally work on passion projects that
          tell local stories.
