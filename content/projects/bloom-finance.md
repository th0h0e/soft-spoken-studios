## Project Overview

Bloom Finance approached me to redesign their personal finance platform, which was experiencing high user drop-off rates during onboarding and low engagement with core features. The challenge was to create an intuitive interface that made complex financial data accessible and actionable for everyday users.

## Technologies Used

- Figma for design and prototyping
- Vue.js and Nuxt for front-end development
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
