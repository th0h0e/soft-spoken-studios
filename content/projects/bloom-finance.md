## Project Overview

A full brand launch campaign for a regional solar installer looking to stand apart in a crowded market. We produced a 60-second anthem spot capturing the emotional side of energy independence—families, sunlit homes, and a quieter kind of pride. Alongside the video, we developed website copy, taglines, and a brand voice guide that repositioned Solara from a technical contractor to a lifestyle brand.
