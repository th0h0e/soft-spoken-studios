## Project Overview

Bloom Finance approached me to redesign their personal finance platform, which was experiencing high user drop-off rates during onboarding and low engagement with core features. The challenge was to create an intuitive interface that made complex financial data accessible and actionable for everyday users.

## The Challenge

The existing platform suffered from several critical issues:

- **Overwhelming onboarding**: Users faced a 15-step registration process with unclear value propositions
- **Poor data visualization**: Financial insights were presented in dense tables that users struggled to interpret
- **Low feature discovery**: Key features like budget tracking and spending analysis were buried in navigation
- **Inconsistent UI**: The interface lacked a cohesive design system, leading to user confusion

## Research & Discovery

I began with comprehensive user research to understand pain points and opportunities:

### User Interviews
Conducted 18 interviews with current and potential users to identify frustration points and desired features.

### Competitive Analysis
Analyzed 5 leading personal finance apps to identify industry best practices and differentiation opportunities.

### Data Analysis
Reviewed analytics data to identify drop-off points and underutilized features.

## Design Process

### Information Architecture
Restructured the app's navigation to prioritize the most-used features and reduce complexity.

### Onboarding Redesign
- Reduced steps from 15 to 5
- Introduced progressive disclosure
- Added clear value propositions at each step
- Implemented optional quick-start for impatient users

### Data Visualization
Transformed dense financial tables into:
- Interactive charts with drill-down capabilities
- Color-coded spending categories
- Real-time budget tracking with visual indicators
- Personalized financial insights cards

### Design System
Created a comprehensive design system including:
- Typography scale optimized for financial data
- Color palette with accessible contrast ratios
- Component library for consistent UI elements
- Spacing and layout guidelines

## Implementation

Working closely with the development team, I:
- Built reusable Vue.js components
- Implemented responsive layouts for mobile-first experience
- Optimized performance for large datasets
- Conducted A/B testing on key flows

## Results

The redesign delivered significant improvements:

- **32% increase** in user retention (first 30 days)
- **45% reduction** in onboarding drop-off rate
- **2.5x increase** in daily active users
- **4.8/5 average** app store rating (up from 3.2/5)

## Key Learnings

This project reinforced several important principles:

1. **Progressive disclosure works**: Don't overwhelm users with all features at once
2. **Data visualization matters**: The right chart can make complex information instantly clear
3. **Design systems save time**: Consistent components speed up both design and development
4. **User research pays off**: Every hour spent understanding users saves days of redesign work

## Technologies Used

- Figma for design and prototyping
- Vue.js and Nuxt for front-end development
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Tailwind CSS for styling
