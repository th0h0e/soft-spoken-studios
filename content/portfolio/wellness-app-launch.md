## The Challenge

MindSpace entered a saturated market dominated by established players with massive marketing budgets. Their differentiator—affordable, accessible therapy for Gen Z—was getting lost in the noise.

**Key challenges:**
- Low brand awareness in competitive mental health space
- Gen Z's distrust of "wellness washing" marketing
- Stigma around therapy still prevalent in target demographic
- Limited budget compared to competitors
- Need to establish credibility while staying approachable

## Our Approach

We developed a video-first content strategy focused on authenticity over polish, real stories over marketing speak.

### Strategy

**1. User Story Series**
We interviewed real MindSpace users (with consent) about their mental health journeys. No scripts, no actors—just authentic conversations about therapy, growth, and vulnerability.

**2. Therapist Spotlights**
Short-form vertical videos introducing MindSpace therapists as real people, not clinical professionals. Their hobbies, their own therapy experiences, what drew them to the work.

**3. Educational Micro-Content**
Quick tips on managing anxiety, setting boundaries, recognizing burnout—practical mental health content that provides value even if viewers never download the app.

**4. Behind-the-Scenes Transparency**
Showed how MindSpace vets therapists, protects user privacy, keeps costs low. Building trust through transparency.

### Content Distribution

- **TikTok**: Primary platform for discovery
- **Instagram Reels**: Secondary reach
- **YouTube Shorts**: Long-tail search traffic
- **LinkedIn**: Reaching HR departments and employers

## The Execution

### Video Production

Created 60+ pieces of content across 4 months:
- 12 long-form user story videos (2-4 minutes)
- 24 therapist introduction shorts (30-60 seconds)
- 20+ educational micro-content pieces (15-30 seconds)
- 8 behind-the-scenes transparency videos

**Production approach:**
- Shot on smartphones and mirrorless cameras for authentic feel
- Minimal editing—fast cuts, on-screen text, no fancy transitions
- Vertical-first framing for mobile viewing
- Always-on captions (85% of views without sound)

### Social Strategy

**Content Pillars:**
- 40% Educational (mental health tips, therapy myths)
- 30% User Stories (real experiences)
- 20% Therapist Spotlights (humanizing providers)
- 10% Product/Features (actual app promotion)

**Engagement Tactics:**
- Responded to every comment personally
- Created videos answering common questions from comments
- Collaborated with mental health micro-influencers (5K-50K followers)
- Used controversy thoughtfully (therapy myths, hot takes on wellness culture)

## The Results

### Quantitative

- **100K+ app downloads** in first 4 months
- **3.2M+ total video views** across platforms
- **450K+ profile visits** from video content
- **28% average engagement rate** (4x industry standard)
- **#1 ranked mental health app** in App Store for Gen Z demographic (ages 18-24)

### Qualitative

- Built active community of 50K+ engaged followers
- Generated 200+ user-submitted testimonials organically
- Featured in multiple mental health advocacy publications
- Established MindSpace as authentic voice in wellness space

### Content Performance Highlights

**Top performing video:** User story about therapy helping with imposter syndrome

**Most shared video:** Therapist explaining "therapy isn't just for crisis"
- 420K+ views
- Shared 12K+ times
- Cited by mental health organizations

## What We Learned

### Authenticity Beats Production Value

Our highest-performing videos were often the least polished. Gen Z can spot overly-produced content instantly and scrolls past it. Raw, honest conversations outperformed beautifully shot b-roll every time.

### Trust Takes Time

Early videos got modest traction. But consistent posting built credibility. By month 3, each new video had a guaranteed baseline audience who trusted the content would deliver value.

### Education Drives Conversion

Videos that taught something concrete (how to find the right therapist, what to expect in first session) converted 3x better than promotional content. Leading with value built trust that led to downloads.

### Community Is the Moat

The engaged community became MindSpace's biggest competitive advantage. Users defended the brand in comments, shared content organically, created their own testimonials unprompted.

## Client Testimonial

"Soft Spoken helped us find our voice when we were afraid we didn't have one. They taught us that our users' stories were more powerful than any marketing message we could write. The content they created didn't just drive downloads—it built a movement."

— Sarah Chen, Co-founder, MindSpace

## The Continued Impact

Six months post-launch, the content continues to perform:
- Evergreen educational videos still drive 10K+ monthly views
- User story series became template for ongoing content
- Community-driven content now accounts for 40% of social posts
- Organic reach eliminates need for paid advertising

MindSpace went from unknown startup to category leader by embracing authenticity, leading with value, and trusting their community to spread the word.
