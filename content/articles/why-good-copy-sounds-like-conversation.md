If you've ever cringed reading your own website copy, you're not alone. Most businesses sound like they're trying too hard—using buzzwords, corporate speak, and language that nobody actually uses in real life.

The problem isn't that the copy is bad. It's that it doesn't sound human.

## The Conversation Test

Here's a simple test: Read your copy out loud. Would you say these exact words to a potential client sitting across from you at a coffee shop?

If the answer is no, you've found your problem.

Good copy passes the conversation test. It sounds like something a real person would say to another real person. Not a corporate entity broadcasting to "target demographics."

## Why We Default to Corporate Speak

There's a reason so many businesses fall into the corporate speak trap. It feels safer. More professional. More legitimate.

When you're trying to establish credibility, it's tempting to adopt the language of "serious business." You add phrases like:

- "Leveraging synergies"
- "Best-in-class solutions"
- "Driving value through innovation"
- "Strategic partnership opportunities"

None of these phrases mean anything. They're verbal camouflage—a way to sound professional without actually saying anything specific.

## What Conversational Copy Actually Means

Conversational copy isn't about being casual or unprofessional. It's about being direct, clear, and human.

Compare these two versions:

**Corporate Version:**
> "Our platform leverages cutting-edge AI technology to optimize workflow efficiency and drive productivity gains across your organization."

**Conversational Version:**
> "We built AI that handles the repetitive stuff so your team can focus on work that actually matters."

The second version is shorter, clearer, and more memorable. It sounds like a person explaining something they care about.

## The Elements of Conversational Copy

### 1. Use Contractions

People use contractions when they talk. "Don't" instead of "do not." "We're" instead of "we are."

Avoiding contractions makes your copy sound formal and distant. Using them makes it sound natural and approachable.

### 2. Choose Simple Words

If there's a simpler word that means the same thing, use it.

- Use "help" instead of "facilitate"
- Say "use" instead of "utilize"
- Choose "end" over "terminate"

Simple words are easier to understand and harder to misinterpret.

### 3. Keep Sentences Short

Long, complex sentences might work in academic writing. In marketing copy, they're killers.

Short sentences are easier to read. They create rhythm. They keep people moving forward.

You can vary sentence length for impact. But default to short.

### 4. Ditch the Jargon

Industry jargon might make you feel smart, but it makes your readers feel confused.

Unless you're writing for specialists who use specific technical terms, explain things in plain language. Your grandmother should be able to understand what you do.

### 5. Write to One Person

Don't write to "our customers" or "users." Write to one specific person.

Imagine your ideal client. Give them a name. Picture them reading your copy. What would you tell them?

Writing to one person makes your copy more focused and personal, even though thousands might read it.

## Finding Your Conversational Voice

Every brand's conversational voice is a little different. A law firm sounds different from a surf shop. Both can be conversational; they just have different tones.

To find yours, try this exercise:

**Step 1: Explain What You Do**

Imagine someone asks what you do at a party. Explain it like you're talking to an interested stranger who knows nothing about your industry.

Record yourself or write it down stream-of-consciousness style.

**Step 2: Notice the Language**

Look at the words you naturally use. The way you structure sentences. The metaphors that come to mind.

That's your natural voice. That's how you should write.

**Step 3: Refine, Don't Reinvent**

Take that natural explanation and polish it. Fix grammar. Tighten sentences. But keep the core tone.

Don't switch to corporate speak in the editing process. If anything, make it more conversational.

## Common Objections

**"But our industry is serious/technical/regulated..."**

Conversational doesn't mean unprofessional. Doctors can explain complex procedures in clear language. Lawyers can discuss contracts without legalese. Financial advisors can talk about investments without jargon.

Being conversational means respecting your reader's intelligence while making your expertise accessible.

**"Won't we lose credibility?"**

The opposite is true. Conversational copy builds credibility because it demonstrates confidence.

When you hide behind corporate speak, you signal insecurity. When you explain things clearly, you signal mastery.

People trust experts who can make complex things simple, not ones who make simple things complicated.

**"How do we maintain consistency across writers?"**

Create voice guidelines. Document examples of what sounds right and what doesn't. But don't overthink it.

The best voice guidelines are simple:
- Write like you talk
- Use simple words
- Be direct
- Be helpful

## Putting It Into Practice

Here's how to make your copy more conversational:

### Website Homepage

Before you start writing, ask: "What would I tell someone who asked what we do?"

Your answer is your homepage headline.

### Product Descriptions

Don't list features. Explain why someone would want this and what they'll be able to do with it.

Talk about the benefit, not the feature.

### About Page

Tell your story like you're sharing it with a friend. Why did you start this? What drives you? What do you care about?

Skip the third-person biography format. Write in first person (we/our).

### Email Campaigns

Write subject lines like you're texting a friend about something interesting. Write body copy like you're continuing that conversation.

Would you send this exact email to someone you know? If not, rewrite it.

## The Test of Good Conversational Copy

Good conversational copy:
- Reads smoothly out loud
- Feels effortless to understand
- Makes you want to keep reading
- Sounds like a person, not a brand
- Builds connection, not just awareness

Bad conversational copy tries too hard:
- Forces jokes that don't land
- Uses slang inappropriately
- Sounds fake-casual ("Hey there, fellow humans!")
- Sacrifices clarity for personality

The goal isn't to sound cool or trendy. It's to sound like yourself.

## Why This Matters

In a world of AI-generated content and template-based marketing, authentic voice matters more than ever.

Your voice is what makes people remember you. It's what builds trust. It's what turns readers into customers and customers into advocates.

Copy that sounds like conversation isn't just more pleasant to read—it's more effective.

## Start Now

Pick one page on your website. Read it out loud. Notice where you stumble, where the language feels stiff, where you wouldn't say these exact words to a real person.

Rewrite those sections in your natural voice. See how it feels.

You'll probably worry it sounds too casual at first. That's normal. You're breaking the habit of corporate speak.

But if you read it to someone else and they say, "That sounds like you," you're on the right track.

## The Bottom Line

Good copy sounds like conversation because good business is built on conversation.

Every sale starts with a conversation. Every relationship begins with communication. Your copy should feel like the beginning of that dialogue, not a corporate broadcast.

Write the way you talk. Talk the way you'd want someone to talk to you. Be clear. Be direct. Be human.

That's not just good copywriting. That's good communication.

And good communication is what builds businesses that last.
