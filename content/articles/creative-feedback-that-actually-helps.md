"Can you make it pop more?"

"It's good, but it needs something."

"I'll know it when I see it."

If you've ever hired a designer, writer, or video producer, you've probably said something like this. And if you've ever been on the receiving end of this feedback, you know how frustrating it is.

Vague feedback doesn't help anyone. It wastes time, drains budgets, and results in work that satisfies no one.

But here's the good news: giving effective creative feedback is a skill you can learn. And when you master it, you get better work faster and build better relationships with creative partners.

## Why Most Feedback Fails

Before we talk about what good feedback looks like, let's understand why most feedback doesn't work.

### Problem 1: It's Too Vague

"Make it more professional."
"This doesn't feel right."
"Can it be better?"

These statements might express how you feel, but they don't give the creator anything actionable.

Professional to you might mean conservative. To the designer, it might mean minimal. Without specifics, you're both guessing.

### Problem 2: It Provides Solutions Instead of Problems

"Move this image to the left."
"Change the headline to [your exact words]."
"Use this exact color."

When you prescribe solutions, you're doing the creator's job for them. And unless you're a trained designer/writer/producer, your solution probably isn't the best one.

You hired an expert. Let them expert.

### Problem 3: It's Personal Opinion Dressed as Objective Truth

"Blue is better than green."
"Nobody likes serif fonts."
"This image doesn't work."

Opinion is fine—it's your project. But present it as opinion, not fact.

"I prefer blue" is honest. "Blue is better" shuts down discussion.

### Problem 4: It Changes the Original Brief

Round One: "Make it bold and eye-catching."
Round Two: "Can it be more subtle?"
Round Three: "Actually, let's go back to bold."

Changing direction mid-project isn't giving feedback—it's changing the assignment. That's fine if you acknowledge it and adjust timeline/budget accordingly.

### Problem 5: It's Coming From Too Many People

When feedback comes from five different stakeholders with five different opinions, the creator has to reconcile contradictions that might be impossible to resolve.

More voices doesn't mean better feedback. It usually means conflicting feedback.

## The Anatomy of Good Feedback

Effective feedback has four components:

### 1. What's Working

Always start with what you like. This accomplishes two things:

**It gives the creator confidence.** They know they're on the right track in some areas.

**It protects good elements.** By naming what works, you prevent the creator from accidentally changing things you want to keep.

Example:
> "The overall layout is really clean and easy to scan. The headline immediately grabs attention. The tone feels exactly right—professional but approachable."

### 2. What's Not Working (The Problem)

Describe the problem, not your solution.

**Bad:**
> "Change this image to a photo of a team meeting."

**Better:**
> "This image doesn't communicate collaboration, which is one of our core values."

See the difference? The second version explains the problem. Now the creator can solve it—maybe with a team meeting photo, or maybe with something better you hadn't thought of.

### 3. Why It's Not Working (The Reason)

Don't just say something doesn't work. Explain why.

**Bad:**
> "This headline doesn't work."

**Better:**
> "This headline focuses on features, but our audience cares more about outcomes. They want to know what they'll be able to do, not what the product has."

With context, the creator understands the underlying issue and can address it.

### 4. What Success Looks Like (The Goal)

Help the creator understand your vision by describing the end result, not how to get there.

**Bad:**
> "Make the CTA button bigger and change it to orange."

**Better:**
> "The CTA should be the clearest path forward on the page. Right now, it's getting lost. Someone should know exactly what to do next without hunting for it."

Now the creator knows the goal (clear CTA) and can figure out the best way to achieve it—which might include a bigger button, but might be something else entirely.

## The Feedback Framework in Action

Let's look at how this framework works with real examples:

### Example 1: Website Copy

**Vague Feedback:**
> "This doesn't sound like us."

**Effective Feedback:**
> "What's Working: The structure is great—you've organized the information really clearly. The benefits are well-explained.

> What's Not Working: The tone feels too formal. Phrases like 'comprehensive solutions' and 'optimize performance' don't sound like how we talk.

> Why: We pride ourselves on being approachable and jargon-free. We want clients to feel like they're talking to a knowledgeable friend, not a corporation.

> Goal: Can we say the same things in simpler, more conversational language? Like how we'd explain this to someone at a coffee shop."

### Example 2: Brand Video

**Vague Feedback:**
> "It's good but needs more energy."

**Effective Feedback:**
> "What's Working: The footage is beautiful. Really strong cinematography. The story arc is clear.

> What's Not Working: The pacing feels slow in the middle section (1:30-2:15). I found my attention wandering.

> Why: We're trying to reach busy executives who might not watch past the first minute if they're not hooked. We need to maintain momentum.

> Goal: Can we tighten the middle section? Maybe faster cuts, or moving some information earlier to keep viewers engaged."

### Example 3: Logo Design

**Vague Feedback:**
> "Can you try some other options?"

**Effective Feedback:**
> "What's Working: I love how clean and modern this feels. The proportions are really pleasing.

> What's Not Working: It feels a bit generic—I could see this logo on a tech startup or a fitness app. It doesn't say 'architecture firm' specifically.

> Why: We want people to immediately understand what we do. In our industry, we're competing with firms that have ornate, traditional branding. We want to be modern, but still recognizable as architects.

> Goal: How can we keep this clean, modern feeling but incorporate something that signals architecture or building? It doesn't have to be literal, but should be distinctive."

## The Questions That Make Feedback Better

When reviewing creative work, ask yourself these questions before you give feedback:

### 1. Is this actually a problem, or just different than I imagined?

Sometimes we reject something because it's not what we pictured in our head. But different doesn't mean wrong.

Ask: "Does this solve the problem, even if it's not how I would have solved it?"

### 2. Am I reacting to the work or my expectations?

If you imagined something blue and it's red, you might react negatively to red—not because red doesn't work, but because it's not what you expected.

Reset. Evaluate the actual work, not your imagined version.

### 3. Is this feedback about the work or about my need for control?

Be honest. Sometimes we give feedback just to feel involved. That's not helpful.

If the work is effective and achieves the goal, consider whether your feedback is actually improving it.

### 4. Am I the right person to give this feedback?

You know your business. You know your audience. You know your goals.

But you might not be the expert on design principles, video pacing, or persuasive writing structure.

Trust that the creator knows their craft. Focus your feedback on strategy, messaging, and brand alignment—not execution tactics.

## Feedback Red Flags

These phrases are warning signs of ineffective feedback:

### "I Don't Like [specific element]"

Personal preference isn't enough. Why don't you like it? How does it fail to achieve the goal?

### "Make It Pop"

This means nothing. Specify what you want to stand out and why.

### "Can You Show Me Some Options?"

Options for what? If you can't articulate what's wrong with the current version, you'll just be comparing options without clear criteria.

### "My [spouse/friend/colleague] Said..."

Unless this person is the target audience or has relevant expertise, their opinion isn't useful feedback.

### "I'll Know It When I See It"

No, you need to know it before you see it. Define success criteria upfront.

### "Just Try Something Different"

Different how? In what direction? With what goal?

## How to Handle Multiple Stakeholders

When several people need to provide feedback, you need a system:

### 1. Designate One Point Person

All feedback flows through one person who consolidates it. This prevents the creator from getting contradictory directions from different stakeholders.

### 2. Prioritize Feedback

Not all feedback is equal. Categorize:
- **Must fix:** Doesn't meet requirements
- **Should fix:** Would improve the work
- **Could fix:** Nice to have
- **Won't fix:** Out of scope

### 3. Resolve Conflicts Before Sharing

If stakeholders disagree, hash it out among yourselves first. Don't make the creator choose sides or try to please everyone.

### 4. Limit Revision Rounds

Specify upfront: "We'll do two rounds of revisions." This forces everyone to be thoughtful with feedback rather than nitpicking endlessly.

## The Feedback Meeting Done Right

When reviewing work together (in person or video call):

### Before the Meeting

- Review the work privately first
- Note specific feedback using the framework
- Come prepared with clear points

### During the Meeting

1. **Let the creator present first.** They might address your concerns before you even voice them.

2. **Start with what's working.** Build on strengths, don't just catalog weaknesses.

3. **Go section by section.** Don't jump around. Complete feedback on one element before moving to the next.

4. **Ask questions.** "Can you walk me through why you chose this approach?" Often the explanation helps you understand decisions you initially questioned.

5. **Take notes.** Write down your feedback so the creator has a clear record.

### After the Meeting

- Send written summary of agreed-upon changes
- Clarify any ambiguous points
- Set clear deadline for next iteration

## When to Trust the Professional

Sometimes you're wrong. And that's okay.

You hired an expert because they know things you don't. Part of getting good work is trusting their expertise.

### Signs You Should Trust Their Choice

- They can clearly explain why they made the decision
- It aligns with the stated goals
- The reason you don't like it is personal preference, not strategic concern
- They've done this successfully many times before

### Questions to Ask Yourself

"Am I rejecting this because it doesn't work, or because it's not what I expected?"

"Is my feedback making this better, or just different?"

"Am I trusting the person I hired to do their job?"

## The Best Feedback is a Conversation

Feedback shouldn't be a one-way download of criticism. It should be a dialogue.

### Ask, Don't Tell

Instead of: "Change this."
Try: "What if we approached this differently? What would that look like?"

Instead of: "This doesn't work."
Try: "I'm concerned this won't resonate with our audience. What do you think?"

### Invite Their Expertise

"You know design better than I do—how would you solve this problem?"

"From your experience, what works best in this situation?"

"I'm torn between two directions. What's your professional recommendation?"

This collaborative approach usually produces better results than dictating changes.

## The Ultimate Goal

The ultimate goal of feedback isn't to prove you're smart or demonstrate control.

It's to help the creator understand what you need so they can deliver it.

When you give clear, specific, constructive feedback, you:
- Get better results
- Waste less time in revision cycles
- Build trust with creative partners
- Create work you're actually proud of

## Your Feedback Checklist

Before you submit feedback, run through this checklist:

✅ Have I named what's working?
✅ Have I described the problem, not my solution?
✅ Have I explained why it's a problem?
✅ Have I clarified what success looks like?
✅ Is this feedback specific and actionable?
✅ Am I focusing on strategy/goals, not execution tactics?
✅ Have I consolidated feedback from multiple stakeholders?
✅ Am I being respectful of the creator's expertise?

## Final Thought

Great creative work is a collaboration between your vision and their expertise.

Your job: Clearly communicate what you need and why.

Their job: Figure out how to deliver it.

When both sides do their part, you get work that achieves your goals and exceeds your expectations.

And that's the whole point.
