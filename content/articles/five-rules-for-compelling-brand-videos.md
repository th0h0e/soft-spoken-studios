Every brand wants to "do video." And why wouldn't they? Video content gets more engagement, better retention, and higher conversion rates than any other format.

But here's the problem: most brand videos are terrible.

They're boring, self-indulgent, and instantly forgettable. They get posted to YouTube, collect 47 views (mostly from employees), and disappear into the void.

After producing dozens of brand videos—some that went viral, others that flopped—we've identified five rules that separate compelling videos from forgettable ones.

## Rule 1: Start With Why Someone Would Care

The biggest mistake brands make is starting with what they want to say instead of why anyone would want to listen.

You want to talk about your company history, your products, your values. That's natural. But your audience doesn't care about your company. They care about themselves.

**Ask yourself:**
- What problem does this video solve?
- What question does it answer?
- What emotion does it evoke?
- What value does it provide?

If you can't answer at least one of these, you don't have a video concept yet. You have a desire to make a video.

### Bad Example:
*"Company X has been in business for 30 years, providing quality solutions to clients across industries..."*

Who cares? This tells me nothing about why I should watch.

### Good Example:
*"Most companies waste 60% of their budget on software they don't use. Here's how to stop."*

Now I'm interested. This is about my problem, not your history.

## Rule 2: Hook Them in Three Seconds or Lose Them Forever

People decide whether to keep watching in the first three seconds. Not the first minute. Not the first 30 seconds. Three seconds.

That's barely enough time to read a sentence.

Your opening needs to:
- Be immediately interesting
- Promise value
- Create curiosity
- Respect their time

**Don't Start With:**
- Your logo animating for 10 seconds
- "Hi, I'm [Name] from [Company]..."
- Establishing shots with no context
- Generic music building slowly

**Do Start With:**
- A provocative question
- A surprising statistic
- A relatable problem
- A compelling visual
- A bold statement

### Example Opening:

**Weak:**
> *[10 second logo animation]*
> *"Welcome to our video about productivity tools..."*

**Strong:**
> *[Quick cut of person drowning in notifications]*
> *"You've got 47 tabs open and can't remember why you opened any of them."*

The second one grabs attention because it's immediately relatable.

## Rule 3: Show, Don't Tell

This is the cardinal rule of video, yet everyone ignores it.

Video is a visual medium. If you're just reading a script to camera, you're using the most expensive tool to do the job of a blog post.

**Instead of saying it, show it.**

### Telling vs. Showing

**Telling:**
> "Our craftsmen pay attention to every detail."

**Showing:**
> *[Close-up of hands carefully sanding wood grain]*
> *[Checking alignment with precision tools]*
> *[Rejecting a piece that's slightly off]*

The second version doesn't say "attention to detail." It proves it.

### Examples of Show, Don't Tell

**If you want to communicate quality:**
- Don't film someone saying "We use quality materials"
- Do film the materials being selected, inspected, and used

**If you want to communicate impact:**
- Don't show charts of how many people you've helped
- Do show one person whose life actually changed

**If you want to communicate expertise:**
- Don't list credentials and awards
- Do show the work being done at a level only experts can achieve

## Rule 4: Respect the Medium (Vertical, Horizontal, and Square All Serve Different Purposes)

Not all videos are created equal. The platform and format change everything about how you should approach production.

### YouTube / Website (Horizontal, 16:9)
- Longer form content (2-10 minutes)
- Educational or entertaining
- Viewers expect production value
- They're leaning in to watch

### Instagram / TikTok (Vertical, 9:16)
- Short form (15-90 seconds)
- Fast-paced, immediate hook
- Native mobile viewing
- Viewers are scrolling, need to stop them

### LinkedIn / Twitter (Square, 1:1)
- Middle ground (30 seconds - 3 minutes)
- Professional but engaging
- Plays well in feed without sound
- Captions essential

### Production Differences

**For vertical:**
- Frame for mobile viewing
- Bigger text, closer shots
- Quick cuts, high energy
- Assume sound is off

**For horizontal:**
- More breathing room in composition
- Can show more context
- Slower pacing acceptable
- Sound is expected

**For square:**
- Versatile but less immersive
- Good for talking heads
- Works across platforms
- Captions carry the story

### Don't Try to Repurpose Everything

The biggest mistake is shooting one horizontal video and cropping it for vertical.

Vertical video isn't cropped horizontal. It's a different composition. Different framing. Different storytelling.

Plan for the format you're shooting in. If you need multiple formats, plan multiple shoots or shoot with both in mind.

## Rule 5: Edit Ruthlessly

Your first cut is always too long.

The amateur filmmaker's instinct is to include everything: every angle they shot, every point they want to make, every moment they liked during filming.

The professional knows that cutting is where the magic happens.

### The Cutting Principles

**1. Every second must earn its place**

If a shot or sequence doesn't advance the story, build emotion, or provide value, cut it. No matter how pretty it is.

**2. Kill your darlings**

That perfect shot you spent an hour getting? If it doesn't serve the story, it goes. Attachment is the enemy of good editing.

**3. Pace varies with purpose**

Educational videos can be slower—viewers are there to learn. Promotional videos must move fast—viewers are there to be convinced.

**4. Silence is powerful**

Don't fill every moment with narration or music. Strategic silence creates impact.

**5. End strong**

The last impression matters most. End on emotion, action, or a clear call to what comes next.

### Before and After Example

**First Cut:** 4 minutes
- 15 second intro explaining who we are
- 45 seconds of founder talking about company history
- 90 seconds of product features
- 60 seconds of customer testimonials
- 30 second call to action

**Final Cut:** 90 seconds
- [Removed intro—unnecessary]
- [Cut company history—viewers don't care]
- 30 seconds: Here's the problem you have
- 40 seconds: Here's how this solves it (showing, not telling)
- 20 seconds: Here's what happened when others tried it

Same information. One-third the length. Infinitely more watchable.

## Bonus: Production Value Isn't About Budget

Here's the secret nobody wants to admit: you don't need expensive cameras, professional lighting, or a Hollywood crew to make good brand videos.

You need:

**1. Good Light**
- Natural light is free and beautiful
- Golden hour (sunrise/sunset) makes everything look cinematic
- Avoid harsh overhead lighting

**2. Clean Audio**
- Bad audio ruins good video
- A $50 microphone beats your camera's built-in mic
- Quiet locations are worth the hassle

**3. Stable Footage**
- Shaky footage looks amateur
- A basic tripod costs $30
- Or use what you have (books, tables, walls)

**4. Intentional Framing**
- Rule of thirds still applies
- Give subjects room to breathe
- Background matters as much as foreground

**5. Good Editing**
- Free software (DaVinci Resolve) is professional-grade
- Cuts should feel invisible
- Color correction fixes a lot

The iPhone in your pocket can shoot 4K video. The limitation isn't your equipment. It's your understanding of storytelling, composition, and editing.

## Common Brand Video Mistakes to Avoid

### The "About Us" Trap

Nobody searches YouTube for "about [your company]." They search for solutions to their problems.

Make videos that answer questions, solve problems, or provide value. Your "about us" can live on your website.

### The Feature Dump

Listing every feature your product has isn't a video. It's a manual. Show me what I can do with it.

### The Fake Authenticity

Scripted "candid" moments fool nobody. If you want authentic, accept imperfection. Real beats polished every time.

### The No-Call-to-Action

You made the video for a reason. Tell viewers what to do next. Visit the website? Sign up? Learn more? Tell them.

### The Sound-Required Video

85% of Facebook videos are watched without sound. If your video requires audio to make sense, you've lost most of your audience.

Use captions. Design visuals that tell the story. Treat audio as enhancement, not requirement.

## Putting It All Together

Great brand videos are:
1. Relevant to the audience
2. Immediately engaging
3. Visually compelling
4. Appropriately formatted
5. Ruthlessly edited

Start with why someone would care. Hook them in three seconds. Show instead of telling. Respect the platform. Cut everything that doesn't serve the story.

## Your Turn

Before you shoot your next brand video, ask these questions:

1. **Why would someone watch this?**
   - Not "why do we want to make it"
   - Why would a stranger care?

2. **What's the first three seconds?**
   - How will you stop the scroll?
   - What grabs attention immediately?

3. **What are we showing?**
   - Not what we're saying
   - What visuals prove our point?

4. **Where will people watch this?**
   - Phone? Computer? TV?
   - With sound? Without?

5. **What can we cut?**
   - What doesn't absolutely need to be here?
   - Where does it drag?

## The Truth About Brand Videos

Most brands approach video like vegetables: they know they should do it, but they don't want to.

The result is videos that check boxes but change nothing.

Great brand videos aren't obligations. They're opportunities to connect, to demonstrate, to inspire action.

They're not about showing how great you are. They're about making the viewer's life better in some small way.

When you approach video with that mindset—generous, viewer-focused, ruthlessly edited—you make videos people actually want to watch.

And videos people want to watch are videos that work.
