Facts tell, but emotions sell. The most memorable copy connects on an emotional level while supporting that connection with logical reasons to act.

## Use Clear, Simple Language

Complexity doesn't demonstrate intelligence – clarity does. The goal is understanding, not impressing people with your vocabulary.

## 1. Catch-all Route Pattern

\- \[...slug].vue matches all routes under its

directory

\- Route segments are collected into an array:

$route.params.slug

\- Nuxt 2: \_.vue → Nuxt 4: \[...slug].vue

2\. Dynamic Route Parameters

\- Single param: \[id].vue → /posts/\:id

\- Optional param: \[\[slug]].vue → /posts/\:slug?

\- Catch-all: \[...slug].vue → /posts/\*

3\. Accessing Route Data (app/pages/\[...slug].vue:5)

const route = useRoute()

// Access params, query, path, etc.

4\. Data Fetching with Dynamic Keys

(app/pages/\[...slug].vue:15-52)

Your pattern is optimal:

const { data: page } = await useAsyncData(

() => `page-${route.path}`, // Dynamic key ✓

async () => { /\* fetch logic \*/ },

{ watch: \[() => route.path] } // Watch for changes

✓

)

5\. Route Validation (optional enhancement)

You could add validation to your pages:

definePageMeta({

validate: async (route) => {

// Validate route params before rendering

return /^\\/articles\\/\[a-z0-9-]+$/.test(route.path)

}

})

6\. Single Root Element Requirement

⚠️ Important: Pages must have ONE root element (no

comments at root level)

\<!-- ✓ CORRECT -->

\<template>

\<div v-if="page">...\</div>

\</template>

\<!-- ✗ WRONG -->

\<template>

\<!-- Comment here breaks navigation -->

\<div>...\</div>

\</template>

7\. Pre-rendering Dynamic Routes

For static generation, you can add routes dynamically:

// nuxt.config.ts

hooks: {

async 'prerender\:routes'(ctx) {

const articles = await

queryCollection('articles').all()

articles.forEach(article => {

ctx.routes.add(article.path)

})

}

}

## Focus on One Main Message

Trying to say everything often means saying nothing effectively. Each piece of copy should have one clear, compelling message that drives toward a specific action.

## Test and Refine

Even the best copywriters test their work. What sounds perfect in your head might fall flat with your audience. Always be prepared to adapt based on real feedback.

Remember: effective copywriting isn't about manipulation – it's about connection. When you genuinely understand and care about your audience, the right words will follow.
